			<li>While planning to contribute the implementation to JBoss in the future, the extensions were designed without overriding or modifying any jBPM classes. This was done to avoid synchronizing our modifications with the constantly changing jBPM codebase. The flexibility of jBPM’s configuration architecture made this possible.</li>
