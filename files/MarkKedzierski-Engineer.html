		<span class="title">J2EE Senior Architect</span>
		<UL>
			<LI>Specialized in developing jBPM extensions.</LI>
			<LI>Developed extensions to JBoss jBPM to support object &amp; role based authorization.</LI>
			<LI>Designed an integration layer which allowed jBPM to be used with any implementation of the java security specifications. The integration layer leveraged the existing interceptor architecture &amp; custom wire bindings. This makes changing the security implementation possible down the line.</LI>
			<LI>While planning to contribute the implementation to JBoss in the future, the extensions were designed without overriding or modifying any jBPM classes. This was done to avoid synchronizing our modifications with the constantly changing jBPM codebase. The flexibility of jBPMâ€™s configuration architecture made this possible.</LI>
